- 👋 Hi, I’m @TJLTM
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded systems and hardware design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff to make UIs I suck at those. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my MakeItRain project, and possibly my AMS project. If you have a similar project then hit me up. 
- 📫 How to reach me just use the email listed or message me 


Question: Does this count as Human interaction?
