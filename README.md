- 👋 Hi, I’m @TJLTM
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded systems and hardware design
- 🌱 I’m currently learning stuff to make UIs I suck at those. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my MakeItRain project, and possibly my AMS project. If you have a similar project then hit me up. 
- 📫 How to reach me just use the email listed

Question: Does this count as Human interaction? 

Why I have these Repos... I have decided to share what i have been working on alone and really i know there are other people out there that need to solve some of the same problems that i have. Mostly my designs are focused on analog data acquisition and some type of automation. really this all about making my life easier in some way or some how saving money or time for me.
